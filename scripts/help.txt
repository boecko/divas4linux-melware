Mapping Only:
Numbers of outgoing calls are sent directly to the assigned SIP 
address. SIP addresses of incoming calls are sent to the 
application with the assigned number.

Register an Address:
Each local SIP address may be configured to be registered with 
the registrar server. The registrar server is configured in the 
properties of the board config.

Call via Proxy:
Each outgoing call may be configured to be directed via a proxy 
server.
<softip_dnmap_connection/>
<softip_dnmap_mapping>
Each mapping entry requires at least the following information:

Phone Number:
The phone number configured in the application.
This may be the local phone number of an application or the phone 
number of the remote device.

SIP Address:
The SIP address which should be mapped to the phone number.
Local phone numbers are mapped to local SIP addresses, numbers of 
remote devices to the corresponding foreign SIP addresses.

Port:
For outgoing calls you need to configure the destination SIP port. 
The default is 5060.

Local phone number: The mapping assures that in an outgoing call 
the calling party number is translated to the FROM: SIP address. 
In an incoming call, the TO: SIP address is translated to the 
called party number.

Foreign phone number: The mapping assures that in an outgoing call 
the called party number is translated to the TO: SIP address. In 
an incoming call, the FROM: SIP address is translated to the 
calling party number.
<softip_dnmap_mapping/>
<softip_dnmap_conn_params>
Further connection setting parameters only have to be done for

Register a local address with a registrar server:

User SIP Address: 
Your public SIP address which is made publicly known by 
registration with the registrar server.

User Name: 
Your user name for authentication at the registrar server.

Password: 
Your password for authentication at the registrar server.

Re-register Time: 
The time to keep your connection to the registrar server active.

Direct an outgoing call via a proxy server:

Proxy Address: 
The IP address or the domain name of the proxy server.

User Name: 
Your user name for authentication at the proxy server.

Password: 
Your password for authentication at the proxy server.

When you are finished, click "Save".
You will get back to the "SoftIP Phone Number Mapping" box.
<softip_dnmap_conn_params/>
<softip_dnmap_mapping_only>

<softip_dnmap_call_proxy/>
<softip_dnmap_phone_number>
Enter the phone number you wish to map to a SIP address. This may 
be either your local phone number or the phone number of a remote 
device. 

All mappings between phone numbers and SIP addresses have to be 
configured in the "Edit Mapping Entry" box and can be seen in the 
mapping table. 

NOTE: If you want to configure a range of phone numbers which call 
the same SIP address, you can enter a * at the end of the number.
<softip_dnmap_phone_number/>
<softip_dnmap_sip_address>
Enter the SIP address which should be mapped to the phone number. 
Depending on the phone number you entered above, this may be a 
local or a foreign SIP address.

A SIP address always consists of a user part and a network part. 
The user part is the user name, the network part may be an IP 
address or a domain name, e.g.: mrsx@dialogic.com.

In case of a peer-to-peer call, you need to enter the device SIP 
address of the remote device instead of the public SIP address. 
The device SIP address consists of user name and IP address/domain 
name of the device instead of the provider.
<softip_dnmap_sip_address/>
<softip_dnmap_port>
For outgoing calls, enter the required SIP port number of the 
destination device.

NOTE: The "User Name" value is set automatically to the user part 
of the SIP address entered above. If required, you can change the 
value.
<softip_dnmap_username/>
<softip_dnmap_password>
"Password" is only availabe if you have selected "Register an

<softip_dnmap_password/>
<softip_dnmap_time>
"Re-register Time" is only availabe, if you have selected 
"Register an Address".

Enter the "Re-register Time" to keep your connection active in 
days (d), hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s).

The default is 1 hour.
<softip_dnmap_time/>
<routing_method>
There are two routing methods available: 'Simple' and 'Advanced'
configuration.

The 'Simple' configuration method uses only the card internal config:
Direct Inward Dialing (DID) to allow the collection of a specific
number of digits and the DID special number, which allows to configure
 a special number with less digits, e.g. for a receptionist.

The 'Advanced' configuration method uses a software daemon to allow a
more sophisticated routing configuration: You can configure not only
the DID length but also a number range, you can configure different
targets (CAPI/Diva API vs. TTY) for different numbers and you can
configure different kinds of call distributions.

Based on the routing method you selected, the configuration is
validated and invalid entries will be disabled (grey background).
<routing_method/>
<routing_called_party_number>
You can use the wildcard character * to match any number, enter a single 
number or a range of numbers, or enter x-s instead of digits ('xxx'
means the same as '000-999').
<routing_called_party_number/>
<routing_did_len>
If you want this entry to be activated when a number of a certain length is
called, configure here the length of the Direct Inward Dialing number.
If you want to configure a special number (e.g. for the receptionist), 
select 'Use special number' and enter the number below.
<routing_did_len/>
<routing_controller>
Select the controller you want to use for this entry. If you select
 the configuration method 'Simple', you can only select controllers
with activated Direct Inward Dialing. Check the configuration of
your hardware. 
If you select the configuration method 'Advanced', you can select
all controllers.
If Direct Inward Dialing is activated, you can select 'any' and thus 
create a common entry for all installed controllers.
<routing_controller/>
<routing_distribution>
Depending on the selected configuration method, you can select 'Call
Distribution' for all calls matching this entry.

If you select the configuration method 'Simple', 'Call Distribution'
cannot be configured. With 'Broadcast', all calls are signaled to all
running applications at the TTY interface and the CAPI/Diva API interface.

If you select the configuration method 'Advanced', you may also select 
'Forward to', 'Disconnect', or 'Ignore'.

'Forward to' means you can enter an internal routing extension and select
the interface this call should be signaled to.

'Disconnect' will disconnect the active call of this controller.

'Ignore' will ignore the call and allow other devices connected to the 
PTMP bus to get the control over the call.
<routing_distribution/>
<routing_extension>
Configure an extension for the routing interface (only available if 
'Call Distribution' is set to 'Forward to'). At the TTY interface this 
number is used to determinate the TTY interface (TTYDS1 to TTYDS99).
<routing_extension/>
<routing_interface>
Select the interface the call should be signaled to (only available if 
'Call Distribution' is set to 'Forward to'). You can select either
 CAPI/Diva API (DAPI), the TTY interface or both.
<routing_interface/>
