              DIVAS4LINUX
              ===========

To compile the kernel modules and the divactrl utility just type

   make

and after successful compilation, use

   make install

to install the files on your system.
(You must be root to do that.)

Note:
--------------------
You can choose between the optimized Diva CAPI driver, or an own version
of common kernelcapi. (you will be asked when doing 'make')
The optimized Diva CAPI makes sense when using Diva cards with CAPI only.

The 'divactrl' tool and all other tools,
scripts and the firmware will be installed to

   /usr/lib/divas


The compilation needs a configured kernel source at

   /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

If your kernel resides in another location, you need to specify
this location with KDIR= , e.g.:

   make KDIR=/path/to/kernelsrc
   make KDIR=/path/to/kernelsrc install

In case you want to install into a special destination directory, use

   make KDIR=/path/to/kernelsrc DESTDIR=/targetdir install

to install all files to /targetdir/usr/lib/divas
Note: this is for e.g. cross-installation only. The path
/usr/lib/divas for running and using the installation must be used.

See README for details of usage.
